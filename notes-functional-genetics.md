Not a scientific journal but very detailed introductory article:

# Orf1ab - 16 proteins

16 non structural proteins?

Is there a functional organization in gene order?

All non structural proteins in Orf1ab and structural after?

## NSP1

Focus infected cell on production of viral components

## NSP2

No function characterized, interacts with (viral?) endosomal proteins

## NSP3

Cuts loose viral proteins, removes degradation tags from host proteins

## NSP4

Assemble endosomes where viral particles are assembled

## NSP5

Cuts loose viral proteins

## NSP6

Assemble endosomes where viral particles are assembled

## NSP7 and NSP8

Helpers for RNA viral replications

## NSP9

Infiltration of host nucleus

## NSP10

Camouflage of viral RNA

## NSP12

RNApol? Target of Remdesivir

## NSP13

resolves secondary structures of viral RNA

## NSP14

RNA proofreader

## NSP15

cleans up residual of viral RNA

## NSP16

Camouflage of viral RNA


# Spike

Attacks ACE2 at human cell's surface

`ccucggcgggca`insertion was important in adapting virus to human host

# ORF3a

Triggers inflammation, release of endosomes with virus?

# Envelope

Envelope. Helps assembly viral lipid double layer? then unkown function

# Membrane

???

# ORf6

Blocks cell's signal to immune system

# Orf7a

blocks theterin? Apopotosis/necrosis?

# ORF8

unknown

# Nucleocapsid

Wraps RNA inside virus

# ORF10

unknown
